        <P id="simple">SIMPLE</P>
        <h2 class="heading1">Fast and efficient assessment</h2>
        <p class="psimple">In order to use rubrics for assessment under CBC, a teacher typically has to spend a lot of time drawing
             activity sheets on paper and then writing down all activities and all student names.</p>
        <p class="psimple">The CBC App simplifies this entire process by creating the same activity sheet for you, automatically prefilling 
            your pupils on the sheet and presenting to you rubric templates for every strand and sub-strand.</p>
        <p class="psimple">All you have to do is click to assign your pupils to the various performance levels. This saves a lot of time
             and makes it possible to perform assessments many times without it being a burden.</p>

        <h2 class="heading1" >Customise KICD rubrics or create your own rubrics</h2> 
        <p class="psimple">KICD provides assessment rubrics that you can use to assess each strand and sub-strand in the curriculum.</p>
        <p class="psimple">The CBC App presents the KICD rubrics in a way that makes it very easy for you to use them as they are or modify.
             If you prefer to create your own rubrics from scratch, the CBC App allows you to do this and the rubrics you create 
             can be reused several times over in the future. </p>

         <h2 class="heading1">Produce formative assessment reports like never before</h2>
         <p class="psimple">Developing formative assessment reports, and especially out of assessment rubrics,
             has always been a challenge for teachers and schools. The CBC App now makes it possible to produce reports about students, 
             subjects, strands and sub-strands in great detail. The reports are highly customisable through the report filters that allow
              you to select what you want to see in the report.</p>

            <h2 class="heading1">Print and securely share reports</h2>
            <p class="psimple">With the CBC App you can easily print dynamic reports and get downloadable versions in .pdf format.</p>
            <p class="psimple">You can also share these dynamic reports via SMS or WhatsApp using a secure shareable link that requires 
                a pin for recipients to view its contents.</p>

            <h2 class="heading1">Manage classes and students centrally</h2>
            <p class="psimple">The CBC App allows you to centrally manage the creation of classes, streams and the allocation of students. This gives the school the right to properly administer the school&#39;s 
                record keeping. </p>

            <p class="psimple">Teacher management is one of the CBC App&#39;s most important features since it is the teachers that create the assessment records.</p>
            <p class="psimple">This feature makes it possible for school managers and administrators to allocate learning areas and classes to teachers, and to have the flexibility to manage teacher access to student records.</p>
